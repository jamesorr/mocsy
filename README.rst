Routines to model ocean carbonate system thermodynamics

Synopsis: mocsy is a Fortran 95 package designed to compute all carbonate system variables from DIC and total Alk, particularly from models. It updates previous OCMIP code, avoids 3 common model approximations, and offers the best-practice constants as well as more recent options. It agrees with CO2SYS within 0.005%.
